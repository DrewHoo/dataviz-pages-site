# Datasets you have to research, not download

Read this when the site's data does not exist as a file anywhere — when the
answer lives scattered across media guides, staff directories, archived pages
and news stories, and an agent fleet has to assemble it. The
`build-time-data.md` pattern assumes an API or a CSV; this is the other case.

Worked example: `how-many-rings` (championship rings per college football staffer,
1990–present). No such dataset existed. ~1,300 people were assembled from
40 championship staffs, each row carrying the source line that proves it.

## Invert the question first

The naive framing is unbounded ("count every assistant coach's rings"). Look for
the small fixed set on the other side of the join: there are only ~40 championship
team-seasons, each with a staff of 10–100. Research those, then compute the answer
with a deterministic join in plain code.

```
small fixed list (champions)  ×  researched rosters  →  join in code  →  answer
```

**The model never counts anything.** Agents extract rows; code does the join, the
counting, and the ranking. A wrong total can then only come from a wrong row, and
every row is auditable on its own.

## Every row carries its own receipt

Make each extracted row include the **verbatim quote** from the source that
supports it, alongside the URL. This is worth the extra tokens for three reasons:

1. It is mechanically checkable — string-match the quote against the fetched page
   and reject rows that fail. A hallucinated row cannot survive.
2. It becomes the UI. Each claim links out with its quote in the `title`.
3. It makes agents concrete. "Return the exact line" produces better extraction
   than "tell me who was on staff."

Grade the evidence, and show the grade. This project separates rows sourced from
a staff list (`roster`) from rows inferred from a documented employment span
(`tenure`), and labels the weaker kind in the UI. Mixing evidence grades silently
is the fastest way to lose the reader's trust when one claim turns out soft.

## Agents are for gathering; scripts are for deciding

Every judgment that can be a rule should be a rule in a versioned file, not a
per-agent decision:

- `data/employment-rules.json` — who counts as staff (patterns + the reason shown
  in the UI). One rule change re-scores the whole dataset consistently.
- `data/name-aliases.json` — the same person spelled differently across sources.
- Merge scripts that dedupe against what's already there, drop low-confidence
  rows, and print what they skipped and why.

Agents re-report things you already have. Every merge script needs a dedupe pass:
in this project one audit "found" 69 missing people, of whom 60 were already in
the data.

## Ship a coverage report, not a vibe

The failure modes of a researched dataset are invisible in the finished product —
the page looks equally confident whether it is complete or missing a third of its
rows. Write a `scripts/coverage-report.mjs` that measures the things you cannot
see, and run it after every merge. The checks that earned their place here:

| Check | What it catches |
|---|---|
| **Depth asymmetry** — overlap between two entities that should share members | One source was richer than another, so an artifact of harvesting reads as a real difference. Two championship staffs two years apart share ~75% of people; when the number was 33%, the thin season was the bug. |
| **Partial membership** — credited for some of a group's events, in a role implying they were there for all | The undercount that contiguous data hides. A photographer credited for 2017 and 2020 looks fine until you learn he started in 1986. |
| **Name-variant splits** — same surname, nickname-compatible first names, same entity | One person silently becoming two, each below your display cutoff. Detect across *all* rows, not just the ones that made the cut. |
| **Image aspect ratio** | A school bio page whose photo is missing serves its site logo as `og:image`. It downloads fine and passes a content-type check; the only tell is that it is landscape. |

Each check should print the suspects, not just a count — the point is to hand a
human (or the next agent fleet) a work list.

## Prompting the fleet

- **Give agents what you already have.** Otherwise they report your existing data
  back as a discovery. Truncating that list is worse than omitting it: three
  agents here independently declared people "missing" who were in the tail I cut.
- **Ask for rejections too**, and make them cheap to report. A sweep that returns
  226 confirmations and 309 rejections is trustworthy; one that only confirms is
  a yes-machine. Rejection counts are the best available proxy for skepticism.
- **Name the failure mode you expect.** "We suspect our thinner season was
  harvested from a worse source, not that everyone left" produces better work than
  "check these names."
- **Demand verification in-loop.** For images: `curl -sIL <url>` and confirm a
  200 with an `image/*` content type before returning it. For people: "a wrong
  face is worse than no face — return null and say what you tried."
- **Batch by beat, not alphabetically.** Agents that hunt "Alabama support staff
  1990s" build reusable context; agents given a random slice re-learn every time.

## Cost shape

Wall clock, not dollars, is the binding constraint — sweeps here ran 20–50 minutes
across 13–22 agents. Two habits pay for themselves:

- **Bake large inputs into the workflow script** rather than routing them through
  the tool call, when the payload is tens of KB.
- **Fix the merge scripts, not the research.** Re-running a merge is free;
  re-running a fleet is not. Journals persist — reprocess them.

## Portraits for a cast of hundreds

If the page shows people, it needs faces, and a gray box beside a famous name
reads as broken. Two things worth knowing:

- **The visible set is the union of every filter's top N**, not the overall top N.
  A well-known name can sit at rank 297 overall and rank 87 inside one filter.
- **Free pass first, agents second.** A Wikipedia/Commons pass with a license
  check costs nothing and covers the famous; it took the coaches view here from
  28% to 66%. Hand agents only the remainder, and point them at the sources that
  actually work: school staff directories (Sidearm CMS CDN), the Wayback CDX index
  for departed staff, hall-of-fame pages, and obituaries.
- Keep a manifest with source, license and caveat per image, and support a
  `locked` flag so a hand-picked photo survives every re-run.
